                    <p>Console Casino was the very first project I ever made, and one I continue to update to this day.
                    It is a collection of casino games that operate within a console window, much like the title suggests.
                    </p>

                <h2>Object Oriented Programming</h2>
                <article>
                    <p>This section of projects its to demonstrate the basic fundamentals of object-oriented programming in both C++ and Python.
                    The Project is constructed as a mockup for companies to enter relevant personal information about an employee such as their
                    name, contact information, address, degree, and both contact and address information for their alma mater. Data encapsulation,
                    template and composition classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and operator overloading are all included in the project, and a
                    UML compliant diagram of each class and its member functions and variables are included.</p>
